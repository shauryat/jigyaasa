In September 2020, three farm bills were implemented in India; they are – The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The first bill seeks to open up the sales of the farm produce outside the APMCs to allow private players to enter the market, allowing more competition and fair pricing. The second bill provides a national template for contract farming, which are, farming agreements with regard to processing, agri-business and a range of services including exporters, retailers and wholesalers which would be carried out at mutually agreed prices. The final act takes away cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities, so they are deregulated and free from the restrictions of the essential commodities act. Butthe Central Government still holds the right to regulate these goods in certain circumstances, such as in case of a war, natural calamity, famine, and also impose stock limits if there is a steep rise in prices. This seeks to remove the fears of the private investors over interference by the state and will help attract investment in cold storage and improvement in the food supply chain. According to the amendment in the Essential Commodities Act, the Central Government can intervene only if there is a 50% rise in the prices when compared to the previous year prices in case of non-perishable goods and 100% rise in case of perishable goods. Now, entities are free to carry out transactions in the ‘trade area’ which don’t fall within the jurisdiction of the state APMCs. There are no market fees and the buyers don’t have to procure a licence for transacting in these areas. The bill also promotes electronic trading which helps the parties in following the real time trade and also integrates the markets in various states. The Price Agreement Bill provides a framework to support contract farming with minimal obligation and for the first time includes farm services such as non-chemical agro-inputs, fodder and supply of seeds, etc.

These transformational changes that were introduced with such political haste met with large protests carried out at the Delhi borders. A few primary concerns need to be outlined about these seemingly revolutionary bills. The Price Agreement Bill does not make it compulsory for the sponsors to have a written contract, so even if the company violates the terms the farmers cannot prove it. Also, there is no provision for penalising the companies that don't record their contracts. The most important point of opposition against the bill is that nowhere does it mention that the price of the contract should be at least the Minimum Support Price. The Essential Commodities Amendment Act allows private players to store as much produce as they want without a cap or a limit restriction, this will only facilitate hoarding by these entities and the state will lose the key to prevent price inflation. The three bills will slowly remove transactions from the regulated state markets to the unregulated trade areas which will wreck the supply chains in the state markets.

A special session of the Punjab assembly on October 20, passed amendments to the central laws removing Punjab from its gambit. Apart from the Governor, these also need the approval of the President, otherwise these would only serve as strong political statements against the central laws. According to these amendments, the sale of wheat and paddy will only be valid if it is above or equal to the MSP issued by the Government. The State Government can also levy fees on the traders and electronic transactions carried out outside the state ‘*mandis*’. The state will have the jurisdiction to order for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply, distribution and imposition of stock limits in case of famine, price rise, natural calamity or any other situation. Amendments on these lines were implemented in the Rajasthan assembly as well. It seeks to penalise traders, if they harass farmers, with a minimum fine of Rs 5 lakh or punishment of 3-7 years, or both. The bill further allows the state to impose a cess/fees on the trade carried out by a private sponsor. Again, theseamendments state that a sale or purchase will be deemed valid only if it is equal to or more than the MSP issued by the Central Government. In Karnataka, Reliance Retail has locked a deal with Swasthya farmers producing company(Raichur) to buy 1,000 quintals of paddy at rates above the Minimum Support Price given by the Government (Rs. 82 higher than the MSP). This comes after Reliance said that it had not done any business in this sector in the past and doesn't plan on doing so.
