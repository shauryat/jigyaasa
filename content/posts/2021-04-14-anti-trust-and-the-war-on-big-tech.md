  title: ANTI TRUST AND THE WAR ON BIG TECH
---
*INTRODUCTION*

It has been historically observed that competition is a virtue of the society. Keeping this in mind the Sherman Act of 1980 was created in the United States. The Sherman Act was formed to tackle juggernauts that dominated the entire market such as oil and railroads. It was built precisely for the highly oriented force that we see in Big Tech today. Formed on the principle of “If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade.” Corporate defendants have persuaded judges in recent decades to narrow the law by requiring, for example, proof of price increases to prove a case. But consumers pay with data, and not dollars, for the services of tech platforms. The Sherman Act makes no mention of prices, and the only goal should not be low prices. The objective ought to be competition. Competition maximizes consumer choice, innovation and quality, and fights economic and political power concentration.

*A CASE AGAINST BIG TECH GIANTS VIOLATING ANTI TRUST LAWS*

The nearly 20-year-old US versus Microsoft case shows how the tech companies of today are breaking the rules. The court held that in "Intel-compatible desktop PC operating systems" Microsoft used its monopoly power to squash the Netscape browser by forcing computer makers to install Microsoft's own Internet Explorer browser instead. Microsoft used its monopoly power, rather than compete on the merits, to try to take over the internet browser market. Ironically, Google wouldn’t have existed if the Department of Justice had not sued Microsoft to avoid its anticompetitive conduct. Similarly, Microsoft also used its PC operating system dominance to exclude competition from internet browsers, Google is using its mobile operating system monopoly to exclude competition from mobile applications. In July 2018, the European Commission fined Google $5 billion for forcing phone manufacturers using Android to pre-install applications from Google and not apps from competitors. 80 percent of smartphones in Europe and worldwide operate on the device, the Commission said. Google cemented its hegemony in mobile search by shutting the door of competition. Google has been directed by the Commission to end its anti-competitive behaviour, but many doubt whether it is too little too late. Google lodged an appeal.

Amazon, too, follows the playbook of the monopolist, picks and chooses which goods customers find and decides who gets to compete on its website, which accounts for almost one out of every two dollars spent online. Amazon also prohibits market suppliers from selling goods that it wishes to sell and bans brands from selling their own products, keeping the retail margin for itself. This exclusionary action, combined with the ability of Amazon to use the data of its rivals to produce Amazon versions of successful goods, giving them priority placement on Amazon.com, undermines the merits of competition. (Chakravorti, 2020)

The technology companies have also expanded through hundreds of acquisitions, in addition to using their monopoly power to suppress competition and take over new markets. Many of these transactions violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, which forbids mergers and acquisitions where the effect "may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.”

*THE OTHER SIDE*

Arguments have also been made in the favour of big tech companies in the same case, contrary to hipster antitrust theory, companies should not be penalized for becoming big and significant. It goes against the core principle of a free economy. Moreover, the big tech companies are spending time and resources to comply with the modern antitrust norms. On few levels, this "antitrust filter" occurs. For one thing, these companies teach their staff about enforcement issues. Their market development and planning departments also work with antitrust policy specialists, both within their own businesses and with external firms, they have retained, to decide if current projects and new goods and services could be run by regulators.

The federal government should consider a more deliberate, wait-and-see approach to competition in highly fluid industries, rather than devoting time and resources to breaking up technology companies. Companies relying on older technology or less responsive business models can quickly find themselves out of favour with consumers as innovations continue to disrupt those sectors. For instance, Sears dominated retail using telephone and mail order for decades. Sears' sales accounted for one percent of the U.S. economy at its peak in 1969. Amazon used its model and projected it on internet which resulted in Sear’s decline. This shows that it is better for the free market to regulate itself. (Gaffarey & Rey, 2019)

It can also be argued that too much antitrust regulation could lead to an inefficient economy as the industries and sectors which require a lot of infrastructure and involve huge investments might fail to perform at their full capacity due to suchfilters and competition. (Perault, 2020)

*CONCLUSION*

In this article, we analysed both sides of the antitrust movement. Arguments in favour as well as against the antitrust war on big techs were provided. The main motive of this article was to make the readers aware and conscious about the antitrust laws and the debate around it.
