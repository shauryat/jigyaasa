Financial Technology, or FinTech, has become increasingly prominent in the past year. The threat of COVID-19 infection has made paperless currency transactions popular and a go-to alternative in nations across all levels of development. FinTech saw the opportunity and rose to the occasion, with platforms such as Gojek, Paypal, and Stripe taking the lead in investments, while start-ups such as SaltPay took the opportunity to enter the market. UK FinTech companies attracted investments totalling to $4.1 billion in 2020, while American firms achieved $22 the same year. Global FinTech investment went up from 14% in 2020 to $44 billion.

Certainly, part of this jump was a directly caused due to coronavirus. The risk of infection led to a rapid shift to paperless transactions wherever possible, thus increasing the revenue of FinTech firms. COVID-19 also resulted in retail stores, particularly in developing countries, implementing technologies that allow paperless transactions to both protect their workers and reassure virus-cautious consumers.

In all likelihood this is not a temporary shift - most companies, after testing FinTech options, would likely not return to physical money. Paperless finances are easier to organise and keep track of. With FinTech, each transaction leaves a virtual trail, reducing black money and embezzlement - particularly in developing countries, where large urban informal sectors often yield significant corruption. Cashless transactions aren’t an entirely new experiment either - many regions are already making the shift. Cash constituted only 1% of Sweden’s GDP in 2018, 4% in the UK, and 8% in the United States - the rest was paperless.

FinTech companies are certainly seeing this shift, and they are taking full advantage of it. The UK banking FinTech company Tide, recently launched operations in India, taking advantage of the pandemic as well as the uncertainty caused by the banknote demonetisation in 2016. In addition to international potential, FinTech also has large number of possibilities within the UK; London alone has an estimated 90,000 financial and professional services firms, each of which are potential clients or partners.

Of course, this shift towards FinTech brings along risks with it. As firms increase in prominence, they gain more clients and a larger media spotlight. This makes them a bigger target for hackers, who may not only target large amounts of money, but also client data. Unlike with paper transactions, using FinTech means that large amounts of money and data, often from thousands, if not millions, of people, is essentially concentrated in one place. This means that security breaches increase in their cost both to the firm and to its clients. Expanding FinTech firms will require investing in better data protection services and security protocols to prevent such breaches.

As FinTech firms continue to expand, so will their risks and dangers. However, FinTech presents an unparalleled amount of opportunities in both streamlining finances and implementing Robotic Process Automation (RPA), as many are beginning to realise. Whether or not we ever get to a fully cashless society, we can be certain that the coming years will create a major shift in the ways we buy and sell.
