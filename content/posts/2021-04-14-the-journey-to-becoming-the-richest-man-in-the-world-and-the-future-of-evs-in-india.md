This is the story of a man who was bullied in school and now is one of the most talked about men in the world of science and technology, often said to be a real-life Tony Stark wanting to leave Earth and colonize Mars; Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa. Musk’s mother Maye, is a dietician and a model. At the age of 69, she was able to sign a contract with Covergirl. At the age of 9, Elon had to move in with his father after the divorce of his parents. At 12, Musk sold a game called “Blastar” to a computer magazine for $500. After graduating from High school, he went to Canada to live with his mother, sister and brother. Elon completed his undergraduate, as he got a degree in Physics and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania. He then travelled to Stanford University to complete his PhD; however, he didn't finish his studies only to try his hand at the dot com bubble.

With his brother, Elon launched ‘Zip2’ in which a few Silicon Valley investors participated. This provided newspapers to city travel guides. Later Compaq bought Zip2 for $341 Million in cash and stock, earning Musk $22 Million. In 1999, he started a banking company called ‘x.com’ using $10 Million. A year later, this was merged with ‘Confinity’ to form ‘PayPal’. Elon had a huge fight with the co-founders of PayPal as he wanted the servers to be shifted to Microsoft windows from Unix. While he was on a vacation to Australia, the PayPal board decided to fire him, and Thiel became the new CEO. Musk was the single largest shareholder of PayPal, so when Ebay bought it in 2002, he earned about $165 Million. With the goal of making Spaceflight cheaper by a factor of 10, he started a company called Space Exploration technologies or SpaceX in early 2002. SpaceX won’t be made public until colonising Mars is made affordable by the company. Later in 2004, Elon made $70 Million of investments in Tesla. ‘Roadster’ debuted in 2006, when he was the chairman of Tesla, now the CEO of the company. In the same year, he came up with the idea of ‘SolarCity’- a solar energy company which Tesla bought in 2016, in a $2.6 Billion deal. In 2008, Musk invested $40 Million in Tesla and loaned the company the same amount to save it from the financial crisis. He was named the CEO of the company the same year. Late 2008 and early 2009 were the worst years of his life when he almost went broke and was living off of his personal loans. Then, SpaceX landed a contract with NASA for space supplies and Tesla saw more investors. In June 2010, Tesla raised $226 Million through its IPO. In 2016, SpaceX Falcon made a successful ocean landing of a space orbital. Then Musk went to found Hyperloop and the Boring Company. Other companies to his name include ‘Neuralink’ and ‘OpenAI’ - a not-for-profit organisation. Towards the end of 2019, another Tesla model ‘Cybertruck’ debuted.

From being in the news for being outspoken about opening businesses during the corona virus lockdown to naming his baby ‘ X Æ A-12’ . In January 2021, he became the richest man on Earth surpassing Jeff Bezos with net worth estimated to be more than $185 billion,

and he gained about $150 Billion in the past year due to the steep increase in the price of Tesla’s stocks.

As per a report by Castrol, most of the Indians would consider purchasing an Electric Vehicle by 2022. Although the customers in India are seeking a smaller price point (average of these are 27 lakhs in other countries), they are willing to spend more time charging these vehicles (about 35 minutes). Tesla has incorporated - Tesla India motors and Energy Private LTD in Bengaluru with a paid-up capital of Rs. 1Lakh. This has a parent company in the Netherlands which will allow it to avail benefits on Capital Gains and dividend payments. Now this will follow directly to customer selling route to avoid building of brick-and-mortar showrooms. It is also looking for land to start R&D and manufacturing in India itself.
