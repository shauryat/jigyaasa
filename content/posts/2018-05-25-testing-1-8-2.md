***Hey Siri! What is the news today?***

Did you know that Coca-Cola’s massive fleet of delivery trucks contributes 3.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases to the world? But now they have made major changes to their supply chain practices and were expected to show a 25% reduction in their carbon footprint by 2020. Not only this, Google also earned RI’s highest CSR score due to their data center using 50% less energy than others in the world. We can clearly see that the companies are shifting from the conventional private marketing system to the Socially Responsible Marketing system. Few years back, we saw how Facebook had an influence on the 2016 election cycle, it failed to protect user privacy and its inability (or refusal) to police content on its platform has shattered its image. And today Socially Responsible Marketing emerged as a response to questionable marketing practices that companies like Facebook followed.

Socially Responsible Marketing (SRM) is based on the idea that market offerings must not be only profit-driven, but they must also reinforce social and ethical values for the benefit of citizens. The first and foremost step in SRM is introduction of sustainable products, which is, an environmental-friendly product during its entire life, i.e., from its production to consumption cycle, there must be no permanent damage to the environment. A sustainable product focuses on the use of organic raw material, renewable energy in the production process, creating a positive impact on the community, reduced cost, improved product quality and creating a more resilient supply chain. Such products create a direct and positive impact on the society. The idea of Socially Responsible Marketing is basically an extension of the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Let us go deep and understand various concepts related to it

***Why is there a need for SRM?***

The major economic criticisms that are faced because of conventional private marketing systems are as follows –

* **Mainstream marketing strategies,** thesegenerally lead to higher prices. Due to the large number of intermediaries in the process of distribution of commodities to consumers, the burden of higher costs of goods and services is borne by the consumer itself**.**
* **Contemporary marketing,** itrelies heavily on aggressive advertising and promotions. To offset these costs, companies charge higher prices through excessive markups. In addition to the economic implications, such marketing strategies exert a significant impact on the values of the society. The advocates of Socially Responsible Marketing argue that the current system creates false wants, i.e., it encourages people to buy more than they need, injects constant desire for material possession, and thus leads to excessive spending. Let us take a basic example at an individual level, students generally have rough pages in their used notebooks, but they tend to buy a separate rough notebook. You all might be thinking how insignificant this example is, but when considering it at an aggregate level it is impacting the environment at a larger scale. **Unethical advertising and promotions, irresponsible market researches, selecting a specific market audience, delivery channel practices are some of the many other factors which forced to adopt SRM.**

  ***Is SRM an extension to Enlightened Marketing?***

  Yes, SRM follows the concept of enlightened marketing which states that “a company’s marketing techniques should support the best long-run performance of the marketing system. This concept contains the five principles, as, **consumer-oriented marketing** wherein activities of a user is focused, while in **innovative marketing,** company is expected to consistently improve its products but if we talk about **value marketing**, its prime focus is on building customer loyaltyand finally, **sense-of-mission marketing and societal marketing** which defines the company’s mission in broader social terms" as opposed to "narrow product terms”.

  ***What are the advantages of SRM? How does it help the companies to grow?***

  It is really encouraging when we come to know that millennials today strongly believe in the growth of the society. The team persuaders, just like the millennials too believe that the Government of India should make a stamp which defines the product as environment friendly so that the future generations can differentiate between harmless and harmful products. In terms of financial advantages, the government has established a number of tax-cuts and other benefits for companies in many industries as incentives to be more socially responsible. For instance, companies that reduce their carbon emissions and pollution levels are often offered tax exemptions and other assets for their cooperation in the country's movement towards environmental awareness and responsibility.

  Also, by using SRM as their strategy, the companies can eliminate the need for legislative and regulative obstacles in the future. Such type of marketing instills the sense of faith in the customers and helps in increasing customer base of that company. Undoubtedly sustainable products in the near future will have a competitive advantage over the chemical-based products.

  I conclude my article by asking the RICH and POWERFUL yet IGNORANT people of our country that if Bill Gates can donate a large amount of his earnings for the public welfare and make his country a better place to live in, then why can’t the rich and powerful individuals/ companies of our country work for the public and its welfare?
